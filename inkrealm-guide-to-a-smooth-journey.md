# Guide to a Smooth Journey

AI makes incredible stories, and your choices make them even more fun. Occasionally, due to the nature of AI, things might not go exactly as intended. This guide is designed to help your journey proceed as smoothly as possible.


## Starting a New Character

<summary>New Character Tips</summary>

If you're unsure what kind of character you'd like to play, click the small circle icon next to the first name field—it will generate a random one for you.

If you already have an idea:
- Enter a name, or use the random option and delete the background so only the name is randomized.
- Write your character's background. Be creative!

Consider questions like:
- Were you a wizard or witch from this world who died and was reborn?
- Did you come from a different world entirely?
- Was your death caused by Truck-kun?

You can even include details from after reincarnation:
- They retained their magical abilities.
- They can easily read and alter minds.
- They're allergic to wands.

Whatever you imagine can be added.

### Example Characters
Below are a few example characters I experimented with. All are set in the Harry Potter universe, as it was the only world available when this guide was first written. I'll add more examples from different worlds as they become available.

<details>
<summary>Harry Potter World</summary>

---

**Tom Hawthorne**

> Tom Riddle experienced all the events of the Harry Potter series. Through unknown magic, he was reincarnated. His powers and knowledge remained intact. Now, he plans to correct his past mistakes and prove that nothing can stop the Dark Lord!

---

**Plagus Wise**

> The literal God of magic. He chose to reincarnate into this world for entertainment.

Despite the simple prompt, this character led to a heartfelt story about a god discovering the joys of human connection. He can do anything, but was lonely—now, he simply enjoys making friends.

---

**Sai Copath**

> In his previous life, he mastered mental magic. After death, he was reincarnated—and his mental powers came with him.

This created a fun narrative about someone with mental abilities far beyond those of ordinary wizards.

---

**Alex Winters**

> This isn’t just a reincarnation—it’s an *isekai*! If this were an anime, the title would be: *I Died and Was Reincarnated into the Harry Potter Universe as an Overpowered Genius, and Now I'm Building a Harem in Another World.*

> Alex masters any spell instantly—but all he cares about are the girls. He wants to build the largest harem the world has ever seen. Oh, and Truck-kun killed him in his past life.

Yes, I created this character. It was a fun joke, and the AI embraced it fully. I include it here to show that you don’t need to be rigid when creating character backgrounds. You can even prompt the AI to begin the story with time skips by describing post-reincarnation events in the background.

---

**Dark Wizard**

> Dark was born in his first life over 100 years after the events of Harry Potter. He studied Voldemort’s rise and fall obsessively, learning everything he could about the Dark Arts, hoping to emulate him. Before he could become a powerful dark wizard, he died.

Now, he’s been reincarnated during Voldemort’s second rise. He knows the future. He knows how Voldemort failed. This time, he will become the Dark Lord’s apprentice—and ensure victory.

## Tips

<details>
<summary>Time Skips</summary>

---

If a plot point is dragging, you can move the story forward with a custom choice.

**Example:** [Harry Potter world] "He spent time with his family and enjoyed their activities, but now it was time to leave for Hogwarts."

This prompts the AI to summarize intervening events and advance the plot. This is especially useful for skipping introductory scenes and jumping into the main story.

<details>
<summary>The AI Lies</summary>

---

Sometimes, when you input a custom action, the AI may claim something can’t be done—despite clear context suggesting otherwise.

You can correct this by re-entering your prompt with your reasoning at the beginning.

**Example:** [Harry Potter world]

> I had a character determined to expose the magical world. I entered a custom prompt: she copied the Hogwarts letter and sent copies to the media. The AI responded that she couldn’t do this because the letter hadn’t arrived—even though it was on her desk.

I re-entered the prompt with: *(She can do this because the letter is on her desk. This was referenced in the scene.)*

This reminded the AI of the context, and she proceeded as intended.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Feedback</summary>

---

The above principle also applies to the feedback option. You don’t need to be as detailed as with a custom prompt—usually, a simple explanation of what’s wrong is enough.

**Example:**
> The character was supposed to steal that object, not buy it.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Fighting Feedback</summary>

---

Sometimes, the AI will resist your feedback.

**Example:**
- **Feedback:** The character was supposed to steal that object.
- **AI:** While the character intended to steal it, they chose not to at the last moment.
- **Feedback:** The character *was* supposed to steal it. They wouldn’t hesitate—they’ve already decided and will follow through.

I’ve found it helpful to copy your feedback before sending. If the AI pushes back, paste it and add clarification. This may take multiple attempts—the AI can be stubborn.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Your Choices Matter in Unexpected Ways</summary>

---

It’s obvious that your choices shape the story—choosing to attack someone will lead to consequences. But less obvious is that your choices can introduce new possibilities that wouldn’t exist otherwise.

**Example:** Suppose a choice says: *"Ask if going to that location is even allowed. Make sure you aren’t breaking any rules."*

This seemingly innocent option now introduces the idea that the location might be restricted. The problem of accessing it likely wouldn’t exist if you hadn’t raised the question.

Remember: sometimes, choices create problems that wouldn’t have existed otherwise. Use custom prompts wisely.

<details>
<summary>Remembering Characters</summary>

---

The AI may temporarily overlook secondary characters if you haven’t interacted with them recently. It hasn’t forgotten—they just need a reminder.

For example, Plagus created an intelligent familiar cat named Nyx, who held conversations with him. Occasionally, I’d add a custom choice like:
> "Plagus talked with Nyx about the day’s events."

This reminded the AI to bring Nyx back, often with a brief summary of what she’d been doing since last seen.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Ignoring Choices</summary>

---

Sometimes, the AI appears to ignore your choice. Often, it hasn’t—it’s just saving it for a more appropriate moment. If your action makes more sense later, the AI may delay it.

Occasionally, it truly does ignore your choice. In such cases, the feedback option usually resolves the issue.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Playing Evil Characters</summary>

---

When playing truly evil characters, the AI may resist—pushing your character toward moral or redemptive choices, even when you specify otherwise.

This type of playthrough usually requires more frequent feedback. You may need to repeatedly assert that your character *will* act on their evil intentions. Until they do, the AI will often try to steer them toward being a 'good guy'.

---

</details>


<details>
<summary>Messing with Canon</summary>

---

The further your game strays from canon events, the more AI may list incorrect things in its choices. The actual story should still run normally, but the choices given by the AI won't always make sense in context. In short, the further off canon story events you go, the more you may need to use custom prompts.
