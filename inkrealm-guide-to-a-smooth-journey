# Guide to a Smooth Journey

AI makes incredible stories, and your choices make them even more fun. Occasionally, due to the nature of AI, things might not go exactly as intended. This guide is designed to help your journey proceed as smoothly as possible.


## Starting a New Character

<summary>New Character Tips</summary>

If you're unsure what kind of character you'd like to play, click the small circle icon next to the first name field—it will generate a random one for you.

If you already have an idea:
- Enter a name, or use the random option and delete the background so only the name is randomized.
- Write your character's background. Be creative!

Consider questions like:
- Were you a wizard or witch from this world who died and was reborn?
- Did you come from a different world entirely?
- Was your death caused by Truck-kun?

You can even include details from after reincarnation:
- They retained their magical abilities.
- They can easily read and alter minds.
- They're allergic to wands.

Whatever you imagine can be added.

### Example Characters
Below are a few example characters I experimented with. All are set in the Harry Potter universe, as it was the only world available when this guide was first written. I'll add more examples from different worlds as they become available.




## Tips

### Time Skips
<details>

If a plot point is dragging, you can move the story forward with a custom choice.

**Example:** [Harry Potter world] "He spent time with his family and enjoyed their activities, but now it was time to leave for Hogwarts."

This prompts the AI to summarize intervening events and advance the plot. This is especially useful for skipping introductory scenes and jumping into the main story.

### The AI Lies
<details>

Sometimes, when you input a custom action, the AI may claim something can’t be done—despite clear context suggesting otherwise.

You can correct this by re-entering your prompt with your reasoning at the beginning.

**Example:** [Harry Potter world]

> I had a character determined to expose the magical world. I entered a custom prompt: she copied the Hogwarts letter and sent copies to the media. The AI responded that she couldn’t do this because the letter hadn’t arrived—even though it was on her desk.

I re-entered the prompt with: *(She can do this because the letter is on her desk. This was referenced in the scene.)*

This reminded the AI of the context, and she proceeded as intended.

### Your Choices Matter in Unexpected Ways
<details>

It’s obvious that your choices shape the story—choosing to attack someone will lead to consequences. But less obvious is that your choices can introduce new possibilities that wouldn’t exist otherwise.

**Example:** Suppose a choice says: *"Ask if going to that location is even allowed. Make sure you aren’t breaking any rules."

This seemingly innocent option now introduces the idea that the location might be restricted. The problem of accessing it likely wouldn’t exist if you hadn’t raised the question.

Remember: sometimes, choices create problems that wouldn’t have existed otherwise. Use custom prompts wisely.
</details>


### Feedback
<details>

The above principle also applies to the feedback option. You don’t need to be as detailed as with a custom prompt—usually, a simple explanation of what’s wrong is enough.

**Example:**
> The character was supposed to steal that object, not buy it.
</details>


### Fighting Feedback
<details>

Sometimes, the AI will resist your feedback.

**Example:**
- **Feedback:** The character was supposed to steal that object.
- **AI:** While the character intended to steal it, they chose not to at the last moment.
- **Feedback:** The character *was* supposed to steal it. They wouldn’t hesitate—they’ve already decided and will follow through.

I’ve found it helpful to copy your feedback before sending. If the AI pushes back, paste it and add clarification. This may take multiple attempts—the AI can be stubborn.
</details>


### Remembering Characters
<details>

The AI may temporarily overlook secondary characters if you haven’t interacted with them recently. It hasn’t forgotten—they just need a reminder.

For example, Plagus created an intelligent familiar cat named Nyx, who held conversations with him. Occasionally, I’d add a custom choice like:
> "Plagus talked with Nyx about the day’s events."

This reminded the AI to bring Nyx back, often with a brief summary of what she’d been doing since last seen.
</details>


### Ignoring Choices
<details>

Sometimes, the AI appears to ignore your choice. Often, it hasn’t—it’s just saving it for a more appropriate moment. If your action makes more sense later, the AI may delay it.

Occasionally, it truly does ignore your choice. In such cases, the feedback option usually resolves the issue.
</details>


### Playing Evil Characters
<details>

When playing truly evil characters, the AI may resist—pushing your character toward moral or redemptive choices, even when you specify otherwise.

This type of playthrough usually requires more frequent feedback. You may need to repeatedly assert that your character *will* act on their evil intentions. Until they do, the AI will often try to steer them toward being a 'good guy'.
